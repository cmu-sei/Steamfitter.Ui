# Steamfitter.Ui Readme

This project uses [Angular](https://angular.dev) 21 and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 21 (see `package.json`). Angular CLI 21 requires Node `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || >=24.0.0`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` (`ng serve`) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4401/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use:
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` (`ng build`) to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/browser` directory. Use `npm run build -- --configuration production` for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Unit tests run on Vitest (jsdom) through Angular's `@angular/build:unit-test` builder, with zone change detection like the app.

```bash
npm test                 # run every spec once (ng test --watch=false)
npm run test:watch       # watch mode (ng test)
npm run test:coverage    # run once with coverage and the thresholds in angular.json
```

Run a subset with `npx ng test --watch=false --include='src/app/data/**/*.spec.ts'`.

Shared test helpers (`renderComponent`, `getDefaultProviders`, `permissionDataProviders`, `mockHubConnectionBuilder`, `activatedRouteStub`, `recordEmissions`, ...) live in `src/app/test-utils/`. They are copied from the shared Crucible UI test standard; only `default-test-providers.ts` and `mock-permission-data.service.ts` are specific to Steamfitter. `vitest.config.ts` applies `patches/` with patch-package when the tests start, because Akita ships ESM that Node cannot load unpatched.

## Running end-to-end tests

`npm run e2e` (`ng e2e`) is configured in `angular.json` with the Protractor builder (`e2e/protractor.conf.js`), but neither Protractor nor `@angular-devkit/build-angular` is a dependency in `package.json`, so this command does not currently work.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
